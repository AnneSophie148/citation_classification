"Thus, B. nigricornis could potentially transmit CaLsol from carrot to potato crops and viceversa.Although eggs and immatures B. nigricornis are rarely observed during visual inspections in the field, the reproduction and presence of this psyllid species on potato crops has been confirmed (Hodkinson et al. 1981;Antolínez et al. 2019) and has been reported to cause severe yield losses in Iran (Fathi et al. 2011).Although CaLsol-positive adults of B. nigricornis have been found in potato crops in Spain, the role of this species in transmitting the bacterium to potato was never demonstrated (Teresani et al. 2015).Accordingly, a study of the possible role of B. nigricornis as a vector of CaLsol on potato was strongly needed because of the important economic losses in the carrot and potato industry associated with pathogen spread (Liefting et al. 2009; Munyaneza 2010; Munyaneza et al. 2010a; 2012; @@CITATION@@ Alfaro-Fernández et al. 2012a;2012b;Bertolini et al. 2015;Munyaneza 2015).For this reason, we conducted a series of transmission experiments under controlled conditions at ICA-CSIC (Madrid, Spain) to evaluate the transmission rate of CaLsol (haplotype E) by B. nigricornis in carrot and potato plants.
