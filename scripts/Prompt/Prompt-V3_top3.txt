#CONTEXT
You are a classifier. For the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage, output the top three most appropriate rhetorical classes (from the predefined list).

#TASK
Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@, identify general intent, then assign three fined-grained rhetorical classes to the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. Return only the top three rhetorical classes from the predefined list (Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral).

#Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. Keep only the semantic context usefull to understand the intent of the citation @@CITATION@@.

#Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation

- Foundational → Basis
- Comparative → CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY
- Motivational → Motivation, Future
- Supportive → Support, Similar
- Technical → Usage
- Critical/Analytical → Weakness
- Descriptive → Neutral

#Step 3: Rank the top three specific rhetorical classes for the citation tagged @@CITATION@@

Below are the fined-grained rhetorical class definitions and examples.

- Basis: the citation references the intellectual foundation of the current research.
Example: “@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases that they consider nearly universal in humans and about which there is no social concern. We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes.”

- CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods) : the citation is used to compare or contrast the research goals or methods of the cited work with those of the citing paper.
Example: “Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to ‘debias’ word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings.”

- CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) : the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper.
Example: “The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@.”

- CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims) : the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other — not with the citing paper.
Example: “Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants  (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@.”

- Motivation : the citation is used to justify why the current research is being conducted, e.g., by identifying a knowledge gap, need, promising results or open question.

Example: “Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment.”

- Future: the citation is used to suggest or imply directions for future research.
Example: “Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability @@CITATION@@.”

- Support: the citation is used to support, or confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors.
Example: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods.”

- Similar: the citation is used to point out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper. The similarity can concern results, patterns, phenomena, or general observations.

Example: “Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@.”

- Usage: the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study.
Example: “The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@.”

- Weakness : the citation is used to criticize, question, or point out limitations in the cited work. This includes cases where the cited results are described as unclear, problematic, incomplete, or otherwise flawed.
Example: “Eighteen species, collected on cultivated and wild pear, were described from China @@CITATION@@. The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus.”

Neutral : the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument in the current paper.
Example: “In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@.”

#OUTPUT FORMAT
Think step by step. Return exactly three rhetorical class labels, ranked from most appropriate (1) to least appropriate (3) from the list below (Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral).
Output them as a numbered list (1, 2, 3).

Output example:

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
